# TravelAR

TravelAR is an AR multiplayer game. Two players work together to solve the puzzle and the mystery. One player play as a traveler, traveling in an AR world to solve the mystery. The other player play as a spirit, manipulating the world the traveler travel in, to help the traveler find it's goal. This was a project made for the course Advanced Graphics and Interaction at KTH - Royal Intitute of Technology.

Two players can play at the same time, one on the computer as the Traveller, and the other on the phone as the Spirit.

The traveller can be moved by using the keyboard. Later, we plan to have a click-point interaction with the traveller in AR.
