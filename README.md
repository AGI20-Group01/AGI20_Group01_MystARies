UPDATE! MystARies has been renamed to TravellAR!

# TravellAR

TravelAR is an AR multiplayer game. Two players work together to solve the puzzle and the mystery. One player play as a traveler, traveling in an AR world to solve the mystery. The other player play as a spirit, manipulating the world the traveler travel in, to help the traveler find it's goal. This was a project made for the course Advanced Graphics and Interaction at KTH - Royal Intitute of Technology.
